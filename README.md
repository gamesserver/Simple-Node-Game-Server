# Simple-Node-Game-Server
A simple online game server, made using Node.js, and MongoDB.

# Instructions
To run this server you must have Node.js installed.
1. Clone this repository and open a command line window in the root directory.
2. Run "node server.js".

Once the server is running, you can connect any number of clients to it via my other repository (located https://github.com/tristanbatchler/Simple-GMS-Online-Game-Client).
