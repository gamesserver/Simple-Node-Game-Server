# Simple-Node-Game-Server
A simple online game server, made using Node.js, and MongoDB.

# Instructions
To run this server you must have Node.js installed.
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create an mLab database and edit the lines in Resources/config.js to reflect this.
3. Open a command line window in the root directory and run "node server.js".

Once the server is running, you can connect any number of clients to it via my other repository (located https://github.com/tristanbatchler/Simple-GMS-Online-Game-Client).
